It's all swing and scoundrels at this bar in Soho, 
as the Inception Group bring a subterranean frenzy of fun to the heart of the city.

A destination that promises to keep the Blitz spirit alive, 
Cahoots invites rascals, dolls, dames and dapper chappers to the heart of the underground party. 
Found below the feet of unknowing Londoners, 
Cahoots is a juice joint for those who thing that those swingin' 20s and 30s were just swell, 
and if you don't? You'd better beat it.
