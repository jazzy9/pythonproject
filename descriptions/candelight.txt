The Candlelight Club is a clandestine pop-up party with a 1920s speakeasy flavour, 
in a secret London venue completely lit by candles. 
You'll be whisked away to those Prohibition days with a heady mix of live jazz music, vintage vinylism, 
delicious cocktails and a party crowd all dressed up in their finest 1920's outfits, marvelling at the stunning setting. 

You can buy just an Entry Ticket to come for drinks and dancing, 
or you can choose to add the fine-dining three-course set menu, which includes a table reservation (
note that your table may be shared with other guests). Alternatively you can reserve your own table for a fee that includes 
Champagne, but not the set menu—small tables will seat up to five people and come with a bottle of house Champagne.
 Large tables will seat up to ten and come with two bottles of house Champagne. 
(Note that table reservation fees are on top of the entry ticket.) 
In addition to the pre-order set menu, there will be a menu of platters and bar snacks that anyone can order from on the night.
