If you want to be transported into the 1930's secret 'Indochine' mansion then look no further. 
Opium is a  Chinatown cocktail bar and 'dim sum' look . 
The design feels like  oriental smoking room meets hipster bar, 
with Chinese vases and burning incense mixed with deep funky beats and retro armchairs.
Be sure to visit the washroom: there are motion-activated lights and the speakers will blast you with terrifyingly loud Mandarin announcements.

The decor is vintage and opulent– but that’s nothing compared to their drinks. 
The signature Opium Cocktail No.1 is poured into a crimson dry ice-based vessel at the table for maximum effect. 
So while you may not be smoking 'opium;, your glass is. A heady, syrupy concoction of two kinds of rum, a lick of absinthe, 
mandarin juice, kaffir lime syrup and a mini-shot of liquid ginseng, it doesn’t taste half bad, either.

To eat, there's dim sum. Strictly speaking, yum cha is a lunchtime food, 
but they’re not playing by the rules here.

Another plus is that the place is open very late - until 3am at weekends, with food served until 2.30am.

To find Opium, look for the jade-coloured door on Gerrard Street, close to Chinatown’s main gate.
