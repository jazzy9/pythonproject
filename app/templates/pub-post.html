 					An abandoned Underground station re-invented as a 1940s-themed cocktail bar, Cahoots is inspired by its history as a second world war air raid shelter. Everything about this venue has been carefully chosen to transport drinkers back in time; swish wooden escalators lead down to the restored tube carriage bar where guests can sip their cocktails from war time thrift hip flasks, old milk bottles and tins. Entertainment includes swing dancing, sing-a-longs around the piano, and jazz nights.
