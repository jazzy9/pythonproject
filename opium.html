 					If you want to be transported into the 1930's secret 'Indochine' mansion then look no further. Opium is a  Chinatown cocktail bar and 'dim sum' look . The design feels like  oriental smoking room meets hipster bar, with Chinese vases and burning incense mixed with deep funky beats and retro armchairs.Be sure to visit the washroom: there are motion-activated lights and the speakers will blast you with terrifyingly loud Mandarin announcements.The decor is vintage and opulent– but that’s nothing compared to their drinks. 
 					<br>
 					The signature Opium Cocktail No.1 is poured into a crimson dry ice-based vessel at the table for maximum effect. So while you may not be smoking 'opium;, your glass is. A heady, syrupy concoction of two kinds of rum, a lick of absinthe, mandarin juice, kaffir lime syrup and a mini-shot of liquid ginseng, it doesn’t taste half bad, either. 
 					<br>
 					To eat, there's dim sum.  Strictly speaking, yum cha is a lunchtime food, but they’re not playing by the rules here.
 					<br>
 					Another plus is that the place is open very late - until 3am at weekends, with food served until 2.30am.
 					<br>
 					To find Opium, look for the jade-coloured door on Gerrard Street, close to Chinatown’s main gate.
