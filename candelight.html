	Candlelight Club is a clandestine pop-up party with a 1920s speakeasy flavour, in a secret London venue completely lit by candles.
	<br>
	You'll be whisked away to those Prohibition days with a heady mix of live jazz music, vintage vinylism, delicious cocktails and a party crowd all dressed up in their finest 1920's outfits, marvelling at the stunning setting.
	<br>
	You can buy just an Entry Ticket to come for drinks and dancing, 
	or you can choose to add the fine-dining three-course set menu, which includes a table reservation with others. Alternatively you can reserve your own table for a fee that includes Champagne, but not the set menuâ€”small tables will seat up to five people and come with a bottle of house Champagne.Large tables will seat up to ten and come with two bottles of house Champagne. 
	<br>
	In addition to the pre-order set menu, there will be a menu of platters and bar snacks that anyone can order from on the night.
