 				<p>
				A sultry prohibition inspired den in the heart of the City, 
				The Bootlegger is a drinking establishment primed for London's retro-lovers.
				<br>Speakeasy themed, and harking back to the underground glamour of the 1920s, The Bootlegger puts two fingers up the the prohibition in a bid to bring London's fun-time folk a unique dose of vintage inspired boozing, with live music, American eats and vintage adornments aplenty. 
				<br>
				From lavish cocktails, to live jazz bands that make it all too easy to while the night away, 
				<br>
				The Bootlegger is a premium haunt, and just the place to drop a few clams
 				</p>
